# Hey, I'm Trent (Tront)

I make multiplayer games, VR stuff, and tools that solve problems I actually have. Been doing this since 2009 - started modding Halo CE, Minecraft, and Garry's Mod, never really stopped.

## What I'm Good At

**Multiplayer Networking** - Transport layers, packet fragmentation, host migration, state sync. I've shipped production netcode with FishNet, Mirror, and raw EOS SDK. I hate multiplayer, but I'm good at it.

**VR Development** - Quest-native, not just PCVR. If it doesn't run on Quest I don't touch it. Voxel engines, compute shaders, 120Hz optimization, spatial voice, physics interactions.

**Tools That Exist Because I Needed Them** - VS Code extensions, Chrome extensions, Discord bots, hardware projects. If something annoyed me enough, I built a fix.

**AI-Assisted Prototyping** - I use Gemini, Claude, and local Ollama models daily. Not for replacing real engine work - for killing boilerplate and getting to the interesting part faster.

## Recent Work (2026)

**[FishNet-EOS-Native](https://github.com/TrentSterling/FishNet-EOS-Native)** - EOS transport for FishNet that bypasses PlayEveryWare entirely. Direct C# SDK. P2P with packet fragmentation, host migration, 3D spatial voice, ranked matchmaking, replay system, anti-cheat. Zero-config setup.

**[csharp-gentle-formatter](https://github.com/TrentSterling/csharp-gentle-formatter)** - VS Code C# formatter that preserves blank line indentation. Exists because OmniSharp/CSharpier strip whitespace and cause noisy git diffs when collaborating.

**[SpeedSlap](https://github.com/TrentSterling/speedslap)** - Chrome extension for YouTube playback speed control. Configurable shortcuts, scroll wheel control, draggable overlay. Because I watch everything at 3x.
